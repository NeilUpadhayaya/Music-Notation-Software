The images attached above are from the note spawner script. This is what allows the notes to spawn and the background to move. It spawns 5 types of notes; sixteenth, eighth, quarter, half, whole notes. There is also a protocol that spawns a rest when not playing for 4 seconds.

**SharpsAndFlats**

This script above spawns in sharps and flats depending on the button input. It detects where the note is and puts the sign directly there.

**SoundGenerator**

The Sound Generator plays sounds when a input is pressed.
