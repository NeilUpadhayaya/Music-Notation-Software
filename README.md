The images attached above are from the note spawner script. This is what allows the notes to spawn and the background to move. It spawns 5 types of notes; sixteenth, eighth, quarter, half, whole notes. There is also a protocol that spawns a rest when not playing for 4 seconds.

**SharpsAndFlats**

This script above spawns in sharps and flats depending on the button input. It detects where the note is and puts the sign directly there.

**SoundGenerator**

The Sound Generator plays sounds when a input is pressed.

**ReplayFunction**

This function allows you see replay the sheet music and see the notes you have played.

**Misc Functions**

These scripts control the functions of restarting the software, creating a fade screen when you start the scene, and start/ restart sounds.

**Arduino Code**

This script allows the arduino to communicate with the computer by turning its inputs to selective keys on the keyboard.

**Prototype Breadboard**

This is the original breadboard design for the arduino keyboard. It contains the structure of the wires and resistors.

**Finished Circuitboard**
